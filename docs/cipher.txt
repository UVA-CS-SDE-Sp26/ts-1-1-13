Cipher

Purpose: Cipher class decodes ciphered mission files using a substitution cipher stored in a key file

Key file format:
Exactly two lines
Line 1: real characters
Line 2: cipher characters

Example:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a

Design:
-constructor loads and validates the key
-HashMap is built to map cipher to real characters
-decipher method replaces each character using the map
-unknwon characters (not found in map) are unchanged

Validation: exactly two lines, same length of characters, no duplicate cipher characters

Testing:
testing verifies:
-correct deciphering of lowercase text
-correct deciphering of numbers
-handling of punctuation
-invalid key detection
